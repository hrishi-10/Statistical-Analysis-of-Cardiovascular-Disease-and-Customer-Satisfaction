# Statistical-Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Disease-and-Customer-Satisfaction

## Overview

This repository contains the RMarkdown and HTML report. The project involves statistical analysis of two datasets:

1. **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in England** — Analysis of factors affecting the prevalence of CVD across local authority regions.
2. **Customer Satisfaction in Furniture Retail** — Examination of factors influencing customer satisfaction scores, with particular focus on delivery times and socio-economic status of stores.
